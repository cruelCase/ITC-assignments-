1. Differentiate Flowchart and Algorithm.
An algorithm is a procedure or set of rules that defines how a program is to be executed. Or we can say that it is a set of instructions for solving a well-defined computational problem. Flowchart on the other hand  is a graphical representation of the steps a program takes to process data. In this, we can use several geometric patterns to illustrate the numerous actions the program carries out. 
With the help of the flowchart, the designer can efficiently segregate the various elements of the process. Also, it facilitates the analysis by giving step-by-step instructions on the problem. An algorithm is a step-by-step summary of the procedure, while on the other hand, a flowchart illustrates the steps of a program graphically.
